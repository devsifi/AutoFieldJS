# AutoFieldJS - Greasemonkey/Tampermonkey Automation

### Background

I had to do a lot of testing during my internship, so I came up with this script to autofill input fields in websites.

Of course I didn't want all of my tests to have the same data, so I made it programmable too so that I know that this particular dataset is for testing a particular module in the backend client.

### Why couldn't I simply use tools like Selenium?

The application I was testing had a frontend and backend client. Automating the whole application was just not feasible as I had to keep jumping between the browser and a desktop client.
